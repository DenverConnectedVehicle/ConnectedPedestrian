1. General
   1. Summary  
   This specification is for either a thermal imaging detection system or a video detection system (henceforth referenced as pedestrian detection system) that will be utilized at existing Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon (PHB) locations in the City and County of Denver (CCD) to determine the presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.  The purpose of utilizing the pedestrian detection system at PHB locations are as follows:
      1. To extend the alternating flashing red indication (wig-wag) of the PHB if pedestrian activity is still detected in the crosswalk, and
      1. To activate an Advance Warning Sign (AWS), typically a W11-2 displayed on either a blankout color LED sign or a full matrix color LED Dynamic Message Sign (DMS), for both directions of travel at each PHB location.  Each AWS will remain activated as long as a pedestrian is detected in the crosswalk no matter the state of the PHB beacon.   
   1. Quality Assurance
      1. The manufacturer of the pedestrian detection system shall possess valid ISO 9001 certification for its Quality Management Systems.

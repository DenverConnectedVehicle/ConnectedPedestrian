# Specification for Advance Warning Sign at Mid-Block Pedestrian Crossing
## Advanced Transportation Congestion Management Technology Deployment (ATCMTD)
### Department of Public Works
### City and County of Denver, Colorado

---

#### General
1. Summary  
This specification is for either a blank out sign or a dynamic message sign (henceforth referenced as Advance Warning Sign or AWS) that will be utilized in advance of existing Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon (PHB) locations in the City and County of Denver (CCD) to warn approaching motorists of the presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.  The purpose of utilizing the AWS at PHB locations are as follows:
   1. To utilize a pedestrian detection system that identifies the presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk, regardless of whether or not the PHB is active, and to notify the AWS to activate its display until such time that the pedestrians are no longer in the crosswalk.  At that time, the AWS can be notified to deactivate its display.
   1. To demonstrate the use of Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) to transport notifications and acknowledgements between the PHB location, where the pedestrian detection system is deployed, and two AWS locations on each approach to the PHB.  Notifications shall be used to activate and deactivate the display on the AWS, while acknowledgements shall be confirmations from the AWS that the message display is activated and deactivated.  

#### Quality Assurance
1. The manufacturer of the AWS shall possess valid ISO 9001 certification for its Quality Management System.

# Connected Pedestrian
## Advanced Transportation Congestion Management Technology Deployment (ATCMTD)
### Department of Public Works
### City and County of Denver, Colorado

This repository seeks comments on the technical specifications for Pedestrian Detection and Advance Warning Sign technologies ahead of procurement.

## Background
In 2018, the City and County of Denver (CCD) kicked off the Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment Program (ATCMTD) grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 

ATCMTD funds cutting-edge transportation technologies to reduce congestion and improve the safety of our transportation system. This is a four-year, $12M effort. Denver is testing and demonstrating connected vehicle (CV) and infrastructure technology for improvements to congestion and safety for Denver residents and businesses.

The ATCMTD program is comprised of three projects: Connected Freight, Connected TMC and Fleet, and Connected Pedestrian. The program as a whole, as well as the projects underneath it, are designed to test the feasibility and value of using new technology to reduce congestion and improve safety. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the impact of the technology at a systems-level and build out the corresponding technology infrastructure necessary for the City to scale after the program concludes. 

### Vision Statement

The goal of this project is to provide individuals accessing our city system of sidewalks with a safer way to cross the roadway. CCD will deploy adaptive pedestrian crossing technology, at select mid-block locations, that can adapt and respond to real-time conditions and alert oncoming vehicles to pedestrians ahead in the crosswalk to prevent traffic injuries and lower the potential risk of a crash. This project will provide real-time alerts to drivers, making crossing the street safer for all members of the public.

ATCMTD serves as the leading-edge transportation technology deployment grant for Denver. Many other Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and public works projects are looking to this program to identify viable pedestrian detection and advance warning signs that meet a broader set of city needs. Technologies that meet Denver's needs here have the potential to scale across many city projects and programs. Additional funding is being sought to expand this deployment.

The initial deployment locations will be at four HAWK crossings:
* East 29th Ave and Gelena Street
* Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd and Gelena Street
* Morrison Road and Raleigh Street
* Green Valley Ranch Blvd and Walden Street

### Process for commenting

Please use one of the two following methods for providing feedback on these technology specifications:

1. Submit a pull request with direct changes in either specification. Please utilize commit comments to provide context for your recommended edits.
1. Submit a ticket for broader recommendations, or non-specific edits.

Denver will review pull requests to ensure that edits don't favor a specific vendor or technology. If the first version of our specifications inadvertently closes off solutions you believe we should be considering, please create a ticket to note that for us.
